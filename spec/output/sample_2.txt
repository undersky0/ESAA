Adding files to your Dropbox


Step 1 Drag and drop a file into your Dropbox folder.




Step 2 The blue icon means your file’s syncing with Dropbox.




That’s it! The green icon means that your ﬁle has finished saving
to your other computers and the Dropbox website. Now that your
file’s in Dropbox, any changes made to it will be automatically
detected and updated to your other computers.




The Dropbox Right-click/Context Menu
When you Right-Click (Windows/Linux) or Control-Click (Mac) a ﬁle or folder in your Dropbox, you’ll see a
menu that lets you do a few neat things with Dropbox:


•	   Share a Folder Invite your friends, family and teammates to a folder in your Dropbox. It’ll be as if you
     saved that folder straight to their computers.
•	   View Previous Versions View a record of changes made to a file. You can choose to go back to an
     earlier version of a file if you’d like.
•	   Browse on Dropbox Website View a ﬁle on the Dropbox website.
•	   Get Link Make a link to any file or folder in your Dropbox. You can then send this link to anyone you’d
     like to view the file — even if they don’t have Dropbox!
