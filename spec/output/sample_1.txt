Dropbox Quick Start


What is Dropbox?
Dropbox is a free service that lets you bring all your photos, docs, and videos anywhere. Any file you
save to your Dropbox will also automatically save to all your computers, phones, and even the Dropbox
website. This means that you can start working on your computer at school or the office, and finish on
your home computer. Never email yourself a file again!




The Dropbox Folder
After you install Dropbox on your computer, a Dropbox folder is created. If youâ€™re reading this guide,
then that means you had no problems finding your Dropbox folder :). This folder is just like any other
folder on your computer, but with a twist. Any file you save to your Dropbox folder is also saved to all
your other computers, phones, and the Dropbox website.


On top of your Dropbox is a green icon that lets you know how your Dropbox is doing:


	         Green circle and check: All the files in your Dropbox are up to date.


	         Blue circle and arrows: Files in your Dropbox are currently being updated.
