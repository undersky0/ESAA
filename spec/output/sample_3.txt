The Dropbox Tray/Menu bar icon
The Dropbox tray or menu bar icon is located on the bottom (Windows) or top (Mac/Linux) of your
screen, and lets you check the status and settings of your Dropbox. The same green, blue, and red icons
that appear on the ﬁles and folders in your Dropbox also appear over this icon to let you know the sta-
tus of your Dropbox.


Right-clicking this icon gives you a few options:
•	   Open your Dropbox folder, the Dropbox website, or the Dropbox help center.
•	   See which ﬁles were recently changed.
•	   View an estimate of how long it will take Dropbox to finish updating files.
•	   Change preferences for your connection, Dropbox folder location, and more.


What do I do now?
Try dragging some photos or docs into your Dropbox. Then visit the Dropbox website at
https://www.dropbox.com. When you log in, your files will be waiting for you!
