Frequently Asked Questions

How much does Dropbox cost?
Dropbox is free! If you run out of space, visit https://www.dropbox.com/plans to view our available sub-
scriptions.


How much space does my Dropbox have?
Free accounts come with 2GB of space (deleted ﬁles and revisions won’t count against your limit). You
can always check your usage by visiting your account settings page at https://www.dropbox.com/ac-
count.


How long until my ﬁles are fully synced?
Dropbox will download as fast or as slow as your network allows, and will try its best to not hog your
connection. If you’d like to limit your upload or download rates, you can change them in Dropbox’s pref-
erences. For step by step instructions, visit the help article at https://www.dropbox.com/help/26.


Dropbox is fast! How could it have possibly synced all of my ﬁles in that time?
Dropbox will look to see if it already has the ﬁle you’re trying to upload. If it senses that it already has the
file, it won’t bother to upload it again. If the ﬁle has been changed recently, it will only upload/download
the changes rather than the whole thing.


How secure is Dropbox?
Dropbox takes the security of your files and of our software very seriously. Dropbox uses Secure Socket
Layer (SSL) and AES-256 encryption. AES-256 is the same encryption standard used by banks to secure
customer data.


Can I access Dropbox on my mobile device?
The Dropbox App is available for iPhone, iPad, Android, and Blackberry. To install Dropbox on your
mobile device, visit http://www.dropbox.com/mobile. You can also get to your Dropbox at any time by
visiting http://www.dropbox.com from your phone.
